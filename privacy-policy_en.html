            <p>Introduction

                Welcome to the Braille Translator website. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. This privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our website.
                
                Information We Collect
                
                We may collect personal identification information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features, or resources we make available on our Site. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us.
                
                How We Use Collected Information
                
                We may collect and use Users' personal information for the following purposes:
                
                To Improve Customer Service: Information you provide helps us respond to your customer service requests and support needs more efficiently.
                To Personalize User Experience: We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided on our Site.
                To Improve Our Site: We may use feedback you provide to improve our products and services.
                To Process Payments: We may use the information Users provide about themselves when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service.
                To Send Periodic Emails: We may use the email address to respond to their inquiries, questions, and/or other requests.
                Web Browser Cookies
                
                Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance User experience. Users' web browsers place cookies on their hard drive for record-keeping purposes and sometimes to track information about them. Users may choose to set their web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If they do so, note that some parts of the Site may not function properly.
                
                Use of Google Services
                
                We use a variety of Google services to help us understand and improve our website:
                
                Google AdSense: This service uses cookies to serve ads based on a user's previous visits to our website or other websites. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network Privacy Policy at http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html.
                Google Analytics: We use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors use our site. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit our site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to our site. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our site, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.
                Google Search Console: This service helps us understand and optimize our website performance in Google Search results.
                Other Online Tools for Statistics
                
                We may also use other third-party services to help us analyze the traffic and usage of our website. These services may collect information such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system.
